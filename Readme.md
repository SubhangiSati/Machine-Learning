# Basic Machine Learning Code Practice Questions

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of basic machine learning code practice questions designed to enhance your understanding of fundamental concepts and programming skills in machine learning. Each question comes with a problem statement, and you are encouraged to solve and implement the solutions using popular machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, or PyTorch.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts
- Familiarity with machine learning libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn, PyTorch)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/basic-ml-code-practice.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd basic-ml-code-practice
```

3. Open the questions folder and choose a question to work on.

4. Read the problem statement provided in each question's README file.

5. Implement your solution in a programming file (e.g., `solution.py`).

6. Test your solution with sample data provided or create your own test cases.

7. Optionally, you can compare your solution with the provided sample solutions.

## Questions Structure

Each question follows a common structure:

- **Problem Statement:** A clear description of the machine learning problem to be solved.

- **Instructions:** Guidelines on how to approach the problem and specific requirements for the solution.

- **Data:** If applicable, sample datasets are provided to test and validate your solution.

- **Solution:** Sample solutions are provided for comparison, but you are encouraged to implement your own solution first.
